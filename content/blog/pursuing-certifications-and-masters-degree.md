As part of my journey into the world of cybersecurity, I have committed to pursuing several key certifications and a master's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. This post outlines my plan and progress so far.

## Certifications

To build a strong foundation in cybersecurity, I am working towards earning the following certifications:

- **CompTIA A+**: This certification covers essential IT skills and knowledge, providing a solid baseline for more advanced cybersecurity concepts.
- **CompTIA Network+**: This certification focuses on networking concepts, which are crucial for understanding and securing networks.
- **CompTIA Security+**: This certification is a fundamental credential for cybersecurity professionals, covering essential principles of network security and risk management.
- **AZ-900**: This is a Microsoft Azure certification that provides foundational knowledge of cloud services and how they are provided with Microsoft Azure.
- **(ISC)Â² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)**: This certification provides a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity principles and practices.
- **CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)**: This certification focuses on applying behavioral analytics to improve overall IT security.
- **CompTIA PenTest+**: This certification is geared towards penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.
- **CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+)** (Optional Voucher): This certification is for advanced practitioners of cybersecurity.
- **ISACA Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)** (Optional Voucher): This certification focuses on managing and governing an enterprise's information security program.

## Master's Degree

In addition to these certifications, I am starting a master's degree program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University (WGU) in 30 days. This program will provide an in-depth understanding of advanced cybersecurity concepts and practices, preparing me for leadership roles in the field.

## Progress and Goals

I have already obtained the CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and AZ-900 certifications. My next steps involve studying for and passing the remaining certifications while also beginning my master's degree program.

My ultimate goal is to specialize in cloud security, leveraging my certifications and advanced degree to protect and secure cloud environments. I believe that a combination of practical certifications and academic knowledge will equip me with the skills necessary to excel in the cybersecurity field.

Thank you for following my journey. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to advance in my career and education.
