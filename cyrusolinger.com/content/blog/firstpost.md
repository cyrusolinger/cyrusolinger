I recently embarked on an exciting journey to deploy my personal website, and it has been quite a learning experience! Initially, I decided to use Hugo for my site's static site generator because of its simplicity and speed. After creating a theme using AI, I was ready to move forward with the deployment.

The first step was to migrate my domain from Bluehost to Netlify. This process involved updating DNS settings and ensuring the domain pointed to Netlify's servers. Once the domain migration was complete, I set up my project in Netlify and configured the build settings to use Hugo.

However, I quickly ran into issues. The build failed multiple times due to configuration errors and missing dependencies. After some trial and error, I managed to fix the configuration and successfully deployed my site. It was a great feeling to see my website live at cyrusolinger.com, hosted by Netlify.

This journey taught me a lot about domain management, static site generators, and the importance of carefully following deployment steps. I'm excited to continue developing and improving my site!
