Today marks yet another transition in my blogging journey: I've moved my site to Eleventy (11ty). Yes, I know what you’re thinking—why switch again? Well, let me share some insights into why I decided to take this step and how it benefits both you and me.

### Why Eleventy?

After experimenting with Hugo and Jekyll, I realized that while both are fantastic static site generators, they didn't quite fit my evolving needs. Here’s why Eleventy stands out:

#### 1. Simplicity and Flexibility
Eleventy is incredibly straightforward. It doesn’t impose a specific framework or structure, giving me the freedom to organize my content just the way I like. Its simplicity aligns with the clean and minimalist approach I strive for in my cybersecurity journey.

#### 2. Faster Builds
Compared to Jekyll, Eleventy has noticeably faster build times. This efficiency is crucial, especially as my blog grows and I add more content. Faster builds mean less waiting and more time for creating valuable posts for you.

#### 3. JavaScript-Friendly
Eleventy’s seamless integration with JavaScript allows me to leverage my existing knowledge and add dynamic features without the steep learning curve. This is a huge plus as I can easily incorporate interactive elements to enhance your reading experience.

#### 4. Community and Support
The Eleventy community is vibrant and supportive. From plugins to tutorials, the resources available make troubleshooting and learning new tricks a breeze. This supportive environment is something I found lacking with Hugo.

#### 5. Better Control Over Output
With Eleventy, I have more control over the output format, which is essential for maintaining the hackerish, terminal-like aesthetic of my site. It allows me to fine-tune every detail, ensuring the look and feel perfectly align with my vision.

### The Future with Eleventy

Switching to Eleventy feels like a natural progression in my blogging journey. It offers the flexibility, speed, and community support that align with my goals. As I delve deeper into cybersecurity topics, I’m looking forward to leveraging Eleventy’s capabilities to provide you with richer and more engaging content.

Thank you for joining me on this ride. Stay tuned for more updates, tutorials, and insights into the world of cybersecurity!
